## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

| Serial No | Challenge | Solution |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Making Code Operating System Independent | Using Makefile the code is made operating system independent |
| 2 | Dynamic Stability Testing | The Dynamic analysis is performed using instrumentation framework Valgrind |
| 3 | Implementing Makefile and Multifile Concept | Some useful resources from stepin modules helps us to understand these automation tools |
| 4 | Working with 2D arrays | Learnt hoe to use pointer to point at a specific location in 2D array . Came to know 2D array is like a matrix for visualisation |
| 5 | Accessing the data from array of struct | The data accessing in struct can't be done with unary operators directly. We need to use it with functions. |
| 6 | Unit test cases for input as a pointer | Made an array of just one element and got the output checked with just that array. So pointer works properly
